**Embeddings are numbers that represent meaning.**
They convert words or sentences into **vectors** (lists of numbers) so that a computer can understand relationships between them.

Example:

| Word    | Embedding (very simplified) |
| ------- | --------------------------- |
| “king”  | [0.52, 1.73, −0.44, ...]    |
| “queen” | [0.49, 1.71, −0.40, ...]    |
| “apple” | [−1.22, 0.33, 0.98, ...]    |

Each embedding is usually **hundreds or thousands of numbers long**.

Computers cannot understand text directly.
But they can understand **numbers**.

Embeddings transform text → numbers in such a way that **words with similar meaning have similar vectors**.

Example:

* “happy” and “joyful” → similar vectors
* “car” and “automobile” → similar vectors
* “cat” and “banana” → very different vectors

So embeddings allow computers to understand **meaning, similarity, and relationships**.

Embeddings place words in a **high-dimensional space** (often 512, 1024, or 4096 dimensions).

In this space:

* similar meanings are **close together**
* unrelated meanings are **far apart**
* relationships form directions (vectors)

Think of it like a map, but instead of 2D (x,y), it’s **hundreds of dimensions**.

Example:

```
happy  →    ●
joyful →   ●  (close)
sad    →                  ● (far)
```

The model learns these positions during training.

During training, the model sees billions of sentences.

For each word, it keeps adjusting its embedding vector so that:

* words that appear in similar contexts get closer
* words that behave similarly have similar vectors

Example:

Sentences:

* “I ate an *apple*”
* “The *apple* fell from the tree”
* “I like fresh *mangoes*”

Because *apple* and *mango* appear in similar contexts, their embeddings move closer.

This update happens **millions of times** until embeddings represent real meaning.

Embeddings are created using **context**.

Words that appear in similar places → similar meaning.

This idea is called:

> **“You shall know a word by the company it keeps.”**

Example:

* “bank” near “money”, “loan”, “finance” → financial meaning
* “bank” near “river”, “shore”, “water” → riverbank meaning

LLMs can produce **contextual embeddings**, meaning the embedding of “bank” changes depending on the sentence.

Embeddings capture meaningful relationships like:

### **king − man + woman = queen**

Why?

Because embeddings encode:

* gender
* royalty
* singular/plural
* past/present
* positive/negative

Example:

```
vector("king") − vector("man") + vector("woman") ≈ vector("queen")
```

This works because embeddings position words in relational ways.


When you type something, the LLM:

1. Splits your text into **tokens**
2. Converts each token into a **vector (embedding)**
3. Passes these vectors through transformer layers
4. Predicts the next token based on these embeddings

Without embeddings, LLMs cannot “understand” meaning.

* Embeddings = numbers that represent meaning
* Similar meanings → vectors close to each other
* They are learned by looking at billions of sentences
* Used for search, chatbots, clustering, recommendations
* Let computers understand human language in a numerical form
